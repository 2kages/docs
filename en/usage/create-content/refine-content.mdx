In addition to creating script content with AI, Vipro also has a feature to help you refine the content for your video.
This content refinement is performed 100% by AI, and you only need to provide guidance to the AI to get started.

When you use **Quick Start** to create a video, Vipro will charge you 1 blue diamond for each content refinement.

- List of content refinement versions for the video
- Currently selected content
- Review content of each version in the list

After entering your content refinement instructions, press enter to request Vipro Studio AI to proceed.
