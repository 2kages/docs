After you're satisfied with the script content in Vipro Studio, click the **Continue** button to review your video configuration before starting the scene creation step.

When you click continue, Vipro Studio will let you choose the voice-over for your video and the visual style for your video.

### Choose Voice-over

Vipro Studio provides 3 different options for you to choose your video's voice-over:

- Basic Voice: Free voice-over provided by Vipro Studio
- Standard Voice: Voice-over from OpenAI
- Premium Voice: Voice-over from ElevenLabs

Note that you will have to pay corresponding fees for the voice-over you choose. If you choose **Quick Start**, you will pay with diamonds.
If you choose **Full Control**, you will pay directly to the corresponding service provider.

### Choose Visual Style

At this step, you can choose the visual style for your video again to ensure it matches your video content.

Additionally, Vipro Studio also gives you an option to **review characters** for your video. This feature will help you:

- Review character designs for your video before scene division. Each character will have an _image prompt_ and Vipro Studio AI will use it to create images for that character.
  This _image prompt_ will be reused when creating scene images to ensure your characters have consistent details throughout the video.
- You can review character images. This is very useful if you use _Midjourney_ to create scene images. Midjourney will create images with highly consistent characters

After completing this step, you can click the **Save** button for Vipro Studio to begin the scene division step.

### Advanced Features for Image Prompt from Version _1.3_

From version _1.3_, Vipro Studio has provided an advanced feature for image prompts.

1. **Smart Prompt**:

Meaning of Smart Prompt:

- You enter prompts in Vietnamese and Vipro Studio will help convert them to appropriate English
- You can use `@` to let Vipro know which characters are in the scene

How to enable this feature:

- Simply check the **Enable Smart Prompt feature** box while choosing the visual style

2. **Advanced Character Review**:

Meaning of advanced character review:

- Before creating characters, you can ask Vipro to tell you which
  - era the character belongs to
  - ethnicity they are
- You can also reuse characters from your old videos. This helps you create multiple videos with the same character system

How to enable this feature:
