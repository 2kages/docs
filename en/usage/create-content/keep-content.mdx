Besides using AI to rewrite script content, you can also use an existing script to create videos with Vipro Studio.

### Script Creation Screen

The script retention screen in Vipro Studio has 2 main parts:

- Content development method: You have 2 choices - **Keep Original Script** and **Develop with AI**.
  Choose **Keep Original Script** to have Vipro Studio use your script to create the video.
- Then enter your video script to start creating the script with Vipro.

From version _1.3_, Vipro Studio has provided some advanced features in the script creation screen:

- You can divide the video into different chapters by adding `---` to the script
- You can create a 1-second pause between video parts by adding `...` to the script
- Note:
  - Dividing the script into different parts will cost more diamonds as Vipro Studio needs to create multiple audio files and then manually join them.
  - Avoid overusing `...` as costs will increase and if the content is too short, audio creation may not be accurate

Example:

```
This is chapter one content
---
This is chapter two content
...
Chapter two has one more line
You can also add ... in the middle of a paragraph. Adding it this way won't cost extra diamonds.
```

With the above example, Vipro Studio will create 3 different audio files:

Audio 1:

```
This is chapter one content
```

Audio 2:

```
This is chapter two content
```

Audio 3:

```
Chapter two has one more line
You can also add ... in the middle of a paragraph. Adding it this way won't cost extra diamonds.
```

When combining these 3 voice-over files together, Vipro Studio will automatically add 1 second of pause between files in the following order:

```
<Audio 1> <1 second pause> <Audio 2> <1 second pause> <Audio 3>
```

The cost will be calculated as
3 times the audio creation, each creation will be charged according to the voice-over service price

### Review Your Video Script

After entering the complete video content, click the **Create New Video** button.

When you use **Quick Start** to create a video, Vipro Studio will charge 2 blue diamonds per 200 words of content. These diamonds will be used by Vipro to identify characters, divide scenes, create image prompts, and prepare YouTube information for the video.
