---

The first step in creating a video with AI is converting your idea into a content script for the video.

With Vipro Studio, we use the most advanced AI technologies currently available like ChatGPT and Claude to help you accomplish this.
You won't need to spend hours writing content for your video anymore but can use Vipro Studio to create content in just a few minutes.

To start writing the script for your video, choose a video template from the previous step that best fits your video idea.

### Content Creation Screen

The content writing screen in Vipro Studio has 5 main parts:

- Content development method: You have 2 choices - **Keep Original Script** and **Develop with AI**.
  Choose **Develop with AI** to have Vipro Studio develop the script for you
- Language: Please select the language you want to create the video in
- Topic: Choose a topic for your video, we have created 10 fixed topics but you can still choose to enter a different topic as you wish
- Duration: Choose the length of the video, depending on each topic you will have corresponding length options. For some topics, you can create videos up to 20 minutes long
- And finally, let Vipro Studio know what your video idea is. The more detailed you write, the more closely the content Vipro Studio creates will match your idea.

### Review Video Script

After you fill in all the information on the content creation screen, click the **Create New Video** button and Vipro Studio will start using AI to write the script for your video.

Depending on the video duration you've chosen, Vipro Studio will create a corresponding number of chapters (maximum length per chapter is 3 minutes - 600 words).
