With Vipro Studio, you can make your video more engaging by easily creating a lipsync avatar that matches the voiceover in your video.

1. To start creating a lipsync avatar, move your mouse to the Chapter timeline toolbar and click the Add lipsync avatar button

2. Here, you can upload the image you want to use to create the lipsync avatar.

  alt='Upload image'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

3. Then start editing the lipsync avatar image before creating the video

  alt='Edit avatar'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

**Note**: Currently, the lipsync avatar technology does not support moving the body, so to make the lipsync avatar not stiff and move smoothly, you should:

* Choose an image with a clear face
* Edit the image to focus on the face of the lipsync avatar
* The face is not blocked, pay special attention to the mouth of the lipsync avatar
* The image has a high contrast to make it easier for AI to recognize the face
* The image is clear, not blurry
* Creating a lipsync avatar can take a few minutes, please do not close the web page or the software

4. When the lipsync avatar is created, you can open the layer up to check. Vipro has automatically synced the time of the lipsync avatar with the video, but you can still adjust it if necessary
