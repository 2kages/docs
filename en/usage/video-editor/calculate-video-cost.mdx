Vipro Studio always prioritizes transparency in cost calculation. We provide a detailed cost calculation tool for each video, helping you understand incurred costs and optimize your budget.

## 1. View Video Cost

To view the cost of a video:

1. Open the video in the edit screen
2. Click on the $ icon in the toolbar

  alt='Vipro Studio on web'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

The system will display a detailed cost breakdown for your video.

## 2. Cost Details

The detailed costs of a video are explained in the [Diamond System](payment/credit-system) section.

If your video is created using the Quick Start Product, Vipro will provide video cost details according to the blue and red diamonds you've used during the video creation and editing process.

Vipro divides a video into multiple chapters and displays the cost for each chapter.

<Note>Vipro does not display video export costs if you use Vipro Web.</Note>

The cost of a chapter includes:

- Voice-over: cost of creating and editing voice narration.
- Image Creation: cost of creating or editing images. Each time you edit images or generate new ones, Vipro will update this cost table.
- Image Creation (Premium Credit): this is the cost of using red diamonds to create videos and animated images.

Vipro also provides the total cost for the entire video and estimates the number of diamonds per minute. This estimation is for reference only and is based on the cost of the video you are currently using.
