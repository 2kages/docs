If the images or audio in your video are not of good quality, you can regenerate media by clicking on the blue Chapter timeline bar below and choosing to regenerate voice or images. Note that when you regenerate, you will be charged diamonds corresponding to the content length.

### Regenerate Images

If you select `Regenerate Images`, an image style selection screen will appear, allowing you to choose a new image style for the scene being edited. Image styles are divided into multiple categories, with each category having different styles. For example: The Cinematic category has 2 styles: `Dramatic Lightning` and `Michael Bay`. You can select a different category by clicking the `Style` button similar to opening a folder on your computer. After selection, click the `Save` button to start regenerating images.

Additionally, you can choose to regenerate individual images/scenes separately by following the guide in the [Edit Scene](/usage/video-editor/edit-scene) section.

### Regenerate Audio

If you select `Regenerate Audio`, Vipro Studio will display the voice-over selection screen for the video. You just need to:

  alt='Regenerate audio'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

1. Select the provider
2. Select the voice
3. Click `Retry` to start

**Note**: Regenerating images/audio will incur additional costs/diamonds.
