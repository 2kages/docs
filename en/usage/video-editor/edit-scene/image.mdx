There are 2 ways to edit a scene in Vipro. When you hover over the scene you want to edit, 2 options will appear: 1 is `Edit Scene`, 2 is `Quick Regenerate Image`.

## Method 1: Quick Scene Edit

Click the `Quick Regenerate Image` button to regenerate the image. Sometimes, when the AI-generated image isn't satisfactory or has errors, this is the quickest way to regenerate the image.

## Method 2: Detailed Scene Edit

Click the `Edit Scene` button for more detailed scene editing. Here you have many options to regenerate images:

- Regenerate image with AI: You can adjust the prompt to create images as desired. Currently, image prompts only support English. Change the prompt and click `Regenerate Image` to start regenerating.

- Use Stock Images: You can select Stock images for the scene in the `Stock` Tab on the right corner. Vipro AI will automatically fill in the search content for you, or you can enter your own search content and click `Search` to find images, then select a desired image and click `Done`.

Note that Stock images are only suitable for real-person content, not suitable for drawing or animation styles.

- Use images from computer: You can select images from your computer for the scene in the `Upload` Tab on the right corner. Then drag and drop your images or click the button to upload an image from your computer. Click `Done` to complete.

### Smart Prompt Feature

As mentioned in the previous section, from version _1.3_, Vipro Studio has added the smart prompt feature to help you easily edit image prompts in Vietnamese.

- When using smart prompt, you only need to make requests in Vietnamese, Vipro will automatically convert to create appropriate images
- You can use `@` to specify characters in the video. For example: `@James` will generate images with the `James` character that you created during character review
- You can easily switch from smart prompt to traditional prompt by clicking the toggle in the right corner
