Besides editing scenes by changing static images, you can also use Vipro Studio's editor to add animations/videos to each scene.

Like static images, you also have 3 options for animated images: **use AI**, **Stock Video** and **upload from computer**.

### Create Videos with AI

To create a video, you need to select the `AI` tab in the editor. For each scene you will have:

<img
  src='/en/images/usage/video-editor/scene-editor/video/edit-scene-prompt.jpeg'
  alt='Replace static image with Video'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

- Original Image: The image you are currently using in the current scene. If you choose to create video from stock with **Quick Start**, this scene will not have an original image
- AI Service: The corresponding service to create animation
- Video Prompt: Instructions for creating animation

After you have reviewed all the above information, you can click **Create Video** to start creating animation for the selected scene. Creating animation takes quite a long time,
depending on the service you choose, animation creation time can take from 40 seconds to 6 minutes.

**Note**: Creating animation with AI is a service that uses red diamonds. Each time you create a video, Vipro will automatically deduct diamonds from your account. The price and video creation time for each service are as follows:

| AI Service     | Video Type     | Creation Time | Price (red diamonds) |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Luma AI        | image to video | 40 seconds    | 10                   |
|                | text to video  | 40 seconds    | 10                   |

| Kling Pro      | image to video | 6 minutes     | 15                   |
|                | text to video  | 6 minutes     | 15                   |
