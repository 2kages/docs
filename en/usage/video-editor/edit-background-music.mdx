## Fine-tune Sound Effects

Open the `Effects` tab in the `Music` section to fine-tune sound effects.
Here you can choose any sound effect to add to your video. For example, during intense scenes, you can choose the `Heartbeat` sound effect to enhance the video quality.

You can choose filters or upload files from your computer similar to the Background Music section.
Click the `+` button to add that effect to the video, click the Play button to preview that effect.

After adding the effect to the video, you can deselect it by clicking the `-` button. To adjust the start time, playback speed, and volume of the effect, click the corresponding buttons below each selected effect.

Tip: You can scrub through the video or select a scene first, then add an effect, and the effect's start time will automatically be set to the current video time.

## Note

Your background music settings will be automatically saved to the video template you chose in the first step when creating the video. If you create another video using the same template, these settings will be defaulted to those from your most recently created video.
