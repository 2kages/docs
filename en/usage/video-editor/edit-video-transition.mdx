Transition effects are effects that change frames between two consecutive scenes (can be images/videos) in the video.

- You can select transition effects from the Transition icon in the left corner menu.
- Then choose one of 7 available effects including: Fade, Swipe, Slide, Flip, Pull Back, Rotate, Fast Motion.

## Note

Your transition effect settings will be automatically saved to the video template you chose in the first step when creating the video. If you create another video using the same template, these settings will be defaulted to those from your most recently created video.
