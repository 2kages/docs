Choosing effects for your video will help make it more suitable for each story. You can select video effects from the Effects icon in the left corner menu. Then choose one of 5 available effects including: Rain, Snow, Dust, Fog, Clouds.

  className='rounded-lg'

Here you can choose to enable or disable motion effects. If motion is enabled, the images in the video will be enhanced with effects like zoom in, zoom out, movement, rotation, and many others. If disabled, the images in the video will remain static.

## Note

Your video effect settings will be automatically saved to the video template you chose in the first step when creating the video. If you create another video using the same template, these settings will be defaulted to those from your most recently created video.
