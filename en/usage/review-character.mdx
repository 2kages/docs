As mentioned in the content creation section, Vipro Studio will help you control the list of characters for your video.

When you approve the content, select **Approve Characters** for Vipro Studio to proceed with creating characters for the video.

### Character Review Screen

  className='rounded-lg'
/>

For each character, Vipro Studio will create an _image prompt_. This image prompt will be used throughout the video creation process.

In the character review screen, Vipro will generate preview images for characters based on the image prompt to help you better visualize the characters before approval.

For videos using **Quick Start** or **Flux** for image generation, character consistency is not currently supported, but you can still review the specifications for your characters.

### Edit Characters

For each character, when hovering over the image, you have 3 options:

1. Edit Image Details: Opens the _image prompt_ editor for the character
2. Regenerate Image with AI: Regenerates the character image using AI without modifying the _image prompt_
3. Delete Character: Removes the character from the list

### Detailed Image Editor

When you select **Edit Image Details**, Vipro Studio will open a detailed image editor for your selected character.

In the editor, you can modify the character's _image prompt_ to better match your character and video content.

### Notes

- Try to include as much information about the character as possible; AI will use these details to create characters that best match your content.
- With **Quick Start**, Vipro Studio charges 1 blue diamond for each character image generation.
- If you use **Full Control** with **Midjourney**, the character images will be used to create consistent character images for each scene.
