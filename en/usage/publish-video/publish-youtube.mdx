## Requirements

- You need to export the video before you can upload it to YouTube.
- To automatically upload videos to YouTube, you need to use the desktop version (PC). Download the desktop version [here](https://vipro.studio/dashboard)

## Upload Video to YouTube on Web Version

Although automatic uploading to YouTube is not available in the web version, you can still edit video content, then download the video and upload it manually.

With Vipro, preparing content for YouTube has become easier than ever, as we generate all the necessary content like video Title, Description, Keywords, Hashtags, and Thumbnail. This content has been SEO optimized, with keywords searched to match YouTube's algorithm, to help your video be more easily discoverable and get more views. This saves you hours of research and content preparation.

If desired, you can still adjust this content, including Title, Description, Keywords, Hashtags, Thumbnail, video publication time, and visibility settings.

Read the Thumbnail editing guide [here](/usage/edit-video/thumbnail-editor)

## Upload Video to YouTube on Desktop Version (PC)

To upload videos to YouTube on the desktop version (PC), you need to do the following:

1. Install **Google Chrome Beta**
2. Set up **Google Profile** on **Chrome Beta**. This profile corresponds to your YouTube Studio account
3. Start uploading videos to YouTube

| Why do we need Google Chrome Beta and Google Profile?
| Google Chrome Beta allows Vipro to simulate user actions to automatically select video files on your computer, automatically fill in necessary content like Title, Description, Keywords, Hashtags, Thumbnail, and publish videos to YouTube. This helps you complete YouTube video uploads with just one click, while also increasing the daily YouTube upload limit multiple times. Additionally, it helps you set up multiple YouTube accounts on the same computer, making channel management easier, maximizing time saved switching between accounts and uploading videos to YouTube.

### Install Google Chrome Beta

- Install [Google Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta) on your computer. Watch the Chrome Beta installation guide video below
