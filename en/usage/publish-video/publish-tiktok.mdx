Similar to YouTube, to upload to TikTok, you need to export the video first. See the export guide [here](/usage/publish-video/export-video)

Steps to upload video to TikTok:

1. Export video
2. Link TikTok account
3. Edit upload content (Title, visibility settings...)
4. Upload video

## Link TikTok Account

In the Export and Upload screen, open the `TikTok` tab, click the **Login to TikTok** button to start. If you have previously linked your TikTok account, you can skip this step.

You will be redirected to TikTok's website in your browser. Here, login to your TikTok account if needed, then click **Continue** to link your account.

A window will appear asking if you want to open the app, click **Open Vipro** to open the app. You can check the box `Always allow vipro.studio to open links of this type...` to avoid being asked every time you login.

After the app reopens, your TikTok account information and TikTok video content will be displayed in the `TikTok` tab. Your account information includes:

- Username
- Avatar
- Maximum video length limit that you can upload.

You can choose `Change Account` to login to a different TikTok account.

## Edit Upload Content

You can adjust the upload content that Vipro AI has generated, including:

- Video caption
- Visibility settings
- Enable/disable Comments, Duet, Stitch
- Enable/disable advertising or regular video type

## Upload Video

You can click the `Upload Video` button to start uploading your video to TikTok. For the web version, your video will be uploaded in the background from our server to TikTok. For the desktop version (PC), the video will be uploaded directly from your computer.

After the video is uploaded, the TikTok screen will display information about the uploaded video, including:

- Video preview
- Link to your TikTok Studio, where you can view the uploaded video on your channel.
