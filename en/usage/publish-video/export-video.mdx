## Export Video

- To upload videos to platforms like Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, you need to export the video first. Click the `Export Video` button to start exporting. This process will take time depending on the length of your video.

- For the desktop version (PC), videos will be saved by default to the `Documents/Vipro/` and `Desktop/Vipro/` folders on Windows. For the web version, videos will be stored on our servers. To change the video save path, click the `Change` button next to the `Export Video` button and choose your preferred path.

- After the video export is complete, for the web version, you can download it to your computer by clicking the `Download` button. For the desktop version (PC), you can open the video folder by clicking the `Open` button.

- You can edit the video again by clicking the `Edit video again` button below.
