**This is an advanced feature, only available to users who have purchased the Standard plan or higher on Vipro.studio**  

With the Vipro.studio app on your personal computer, you can easily check your _"competitor's"_ channel right in the app and copy the content of any video to transform it into your own.  

## Add a YouTube Channel to Track  

To get started, you need to identify the URL of the channel you want to track. Click on the channel name on YouTube, and you’ll be redirected to that channel’s homepage.

  alt='Channel address'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

To compile all the videos from that channel, open the Vipro.studio app and follow the steps shown in the image below.

  alt='Youtube video list on Vipro.studio'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

When the "Add YouTube Content" window appears, paste the channel URL you obtained in the first step and click "Import Content."

  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

Vipro.studio will proceed to download the video information from the channel you entered, making it easier for you to _monitor_.

  alt='youtube video list'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

For each video, you’ll have the following details:  
* Thumbnail  
* Title  
* Content (this is the speech-to-text transcript of the video)  
* Video description  
* View count  
* Like count  
* Comment count  

Based on this information, you can select a suitable video to copy and transform into your own.  

## Copy a Competitor’s Video Content  

To start copying a video, you first need to extract its content.  

From the video list, click the **Get Subtitles** button.  

<img  
  src='/en/images/usage/spy-channels/spy-channels-5.jpeg'  
  alt='youtube video list'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

Once the subtitles are successfully retrieved, click the **Clone Video** button to begin creating a similar video.  

A video cloning window will appear, giving you two options:  

* Reuse the entire original video content to create a new video  
* Translate the language, manually refine the content, and then generate a new video

  alt='translate content'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

**Note**: The content extracted from YouTube usually lacks punctuation and clear paragraph breaks, so be mindful when creating a new video from it.  

Once you’re satisfied with the content, click the **Create Video** button to proceed. You’ll be redirected to the template selection screen (you can choose a quick-start template or full customization).  

<img  
  src='/en/images/usage/spy-channels/spy-channels-7.jpeg'  
  alt='select template'  
  className='rounded-lg'  
/>  

After selecting a template, Vipro will automatically populate the new video content for you, allowing you to get started quickly.

**Important Notes**:  
* The YouTube video tracking feature is only available to users who have purchased a paid plan on Vipro.studio.  
* Standard plan users get 3 video copy attempts per day.  
* Creator and Studio plan users have unlimited video copying.
