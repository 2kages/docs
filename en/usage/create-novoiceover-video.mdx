Creating videos without voiceover allows you to make videos without audio and subtitles, where scenes are divided based on video content with fixed scene durations. Common types of videos in this category include music videos and animation videos. Note that this feature is only available on the desktop version. Check out a sample video below:

To create a video without voiceover, you first need to create a new video template in the Custom Workflow section. Refer to the custom workflow guide [here](/introduction/custom-workflow):

- First, select Create New Video
- Then choose Custom Workflow, Create Custom Template

<img
  src='/en/images/usage/create-novoiceover-video/create-novoiceover-video-1.jpg'
  alt='Create video without voiceover'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

- The steps for creating a custom template are identical to creating a regular custom template, with the only difference being in step 3, Voice Over. Here, select `No voiceover`. The duration will be the same for all scenes, so choose an appropriate number.

<img
  src='/en/images/usage/create-novoiceover-video/create-novoiceover-video-2.jpg'
  alt='Create video without voiceover'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

- After creating the custom template, continue to create a new video in the Custom Workflow section, select the template you just created above, then create the video as usual. The resulting video will have no voiceover or subtitles.
  You can add your own voiceover, audio, and effects by following the [background music guide](/usage/video-editor/add-background-music) and [effects guide](/usage/video-editor/add-video-effects).

Good luck!
