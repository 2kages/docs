Starting from version _1.3_, **Vipro Studio** provides you with a very useful tool for producing videos for multiple channels in different languages. We call this the video cloning feature.

Steps to clone a video:

### Select the Video you want to clone, then click on the action menu in the top right corner and select **Clone Video**

  alt='Select Video'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

### Choose the language you want to convert to, then click the **Clone Video** button

<img
  src='/en/images/usage/clone-a-video/select-language.jpg'
  alt='Select Language'
  className='rounded-lg'
/>

Vipro will automatically clone the video, change it to your chosen language, and recreate the voice-over for your video.

When the video is successfully cloned, you will be redirected to the new video editing page.

Notes:

- Vipro will keep the original images and video to minimize costs.
- For videos created using quick start, Vipro will charge:
  - 1 blue diamond per video chapter (videos shorter than 3 minutes are usually reduced to 1 chapter)
  - Creating voice-over for the new video (since the language is changed, a new voice-over file needs to be created)
