Once you're familiar with the quick start templates, you can begin exploring how to create fully customized templates on Vipro PC.

## How is full control different from quick start?

The full control template gives you more control compared to quick start templates, and you can freely use the services you subscribe to.
Additionally, you will pay directly to the AI service providers you choose rather than going through Vipro's system.

Furthermore, when using the full control template, you can:

- Connect to your Midjourney account to generate images
- Use your personal voice clone on ElevenLabs

## How to get started with full control
