The number of diamonds displayed on the left toolbar is shown with a maximum of 3 characters. For example, if you have 1879 blue diamonds, we will display it as 1.88K blue diamonds.

To view detailed counts of blue and red diamonds, you can click on the avatar in the bottom left corner. The application will display a detailed information page showing the number of blue and red diamonds you have.
