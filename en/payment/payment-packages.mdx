For example:

- You purchase a Standard annual package on September 20, 2024
- With this package, you get 600 blue diamonds monthly
- By October 10, 2024, you buy an additional 125 blue diamonds, your blue diamond count is now 725
- By October 20, 2024, your blue diamonds will be reset to 600
- By September 20, 2025, if you don't continue using the service, your blue diamonds will be reset to 0
- Therefore, we recommend not accumulating diamonds

## 6. Payment Policy
