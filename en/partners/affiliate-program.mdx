- Once you have your affiliate code, you can create sharing links in the format:

```
https://app.vipro.studio/<path>?ref=<affiliate-code>
https://vipro.studio/<path>?ref=<affiliate-code>
```

By adding the parameter `ref=<affiliate-code>` to any URL on https://vipro.studio or https://app.vipro.studio, you can track your revenue.

When any user uses your sharing link, if they make a payment within 30 days, their order will be credited to your revenue.

Examples of valid links:

```
https://vipro.studio/?ref=AFY67D
https://app.vipro.studio/profile/upgrade?ref=AFY67D
```

- After creating your sharing link, you can test it by logging into Vipro with a different email and using your link `https://app.vipro.studio/profile/upgrade?ref=<affiliate-code>`. Vipro will open the payment screen with your affiliate code pre-filled
